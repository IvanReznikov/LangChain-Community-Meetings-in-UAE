- **Code** → Place your project files, Jupyter notebooks, or scripts into the `code/` folder of the correct event date.

## 🔄 How to Contribute

2. **Create a branch** with your name/topic  
```

## ✅ Best Practices

- Keep filenames **clear and descriptive**.  
- Use relative paths in your code so others can run it easily.  
- Add a short `README.md` inside your code folder if setup is needed.  
- Don’t upload large datasets; instead, link to them. 


## 🤝 Community Etiquette

- Be respectful and constructive in comments and discussions.  
- Share only content you own or have the right to distribute.  
- Help others if you see questions or issues with their contributions.
